            <p>In this project, the aim is to explore the creative collaboration between human and machine.</p>
            <p>The designed boids play a role in order to step away from the artificial nature of the system, 
                functioning as live autonomous beings. With this, I question not only the computer as the creator, 
                with its innate man-made and synthetic aesthetic, but also investigate its redefinition as an organic system.</p>
            <p>It critically highlights the innate interpositioning nature of the human being. Rather than simply co-living with other structures, the tendency is to disturb or rearrange its natural order, forcing ourselves into this new environment.</p>
